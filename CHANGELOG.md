# 0.5.0

Added {plover:clear_trans_state} as default state
this means that output → start attached is required (to ensure that attachment works)

handles edge cases where:

`hello world <escape>Fw ciw world {:uppercase_everything}` → `hello WORLD WORLD`

# 0.4.0

plover-vim mostly finished

number theory still needs to be finalized
