* Plover-vim
- this is an ambitious project that aims to make vim faster and more ergonomic

* Aims:
- Highly extensible and customisable commands and translations
- (mostly) single chords for virtually every vim command combination
- Ability to do everything in insert mode (no more normal mode)

* Motivation:
- slowness of changing between insert and normal mode
- Emily's [[https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-modifiers][modifiers]]
	- Contains all control, alt, windows, etc combined with every symbol that you would ever dream of
- Emily's [[https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-symbols][symbols]]
	- Symbols with full control over spacing, capitalization and repetition

* Will not be implemented:
- control commands (Already done in Emily's symbol + modifier system)

* Prerequisites
- Install python-plover-dictionary from plover's plugins
	- Aerick has a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQZp7RX-h6o][video]] on this

* Installation
- Clone this repository (recommended putting this where you store your Plover dictionaries)
- Update all git submodules

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/Josiah-tan/plover-vim.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
#+END_SRC

* Modules:
- This repository separates the different dictionaries available into different modules
	- Therefore you have control over what you want to include

** relative-number
*** What is relativenumbering in vim?
- If you don't know what relative numbering is, then you are in for a treat
- Basically it allows you to move more quickly between different lines
- I recommend checking out 
	- :help relativenumber
- It is good stuff

*** How does this module improve vim?
- You can jump to different lines (up and down) in a single stroke
- This is achieved by stroking a number like usual in addition another chord
	- '-7R' => down 7 times
	- '1-6B' => up 16 times
	- '1EUR7' => down 71 times
- Note that 'R' and 'B' are the same keys as what you'd use in qwerty for up and down

*** Limitations
- You can't go past 99 lines at a time

*** Usage
- copy templates/simple.py and add it to your dictionaries for a simple configuration
- copy templates/customised.py for a more customised experience

** TODO character-commands
*** How does this module improve vim? 
- This module is inspired by emily's modifier system to generate all the characters
	- This means that the vowels and left hand side are utilised for the characters
	- We can only customise right hand side chords
- Everything below are the default configs (can be disabled)
**** searching characters
- There are a few methods of searching
	- f + character: find character forwards in the same line and go to that character
	- F + character: find character backwards in the same line and go to that character
	- t + character: find character forwards in the same line and go just before that character
	- T + character: find character backwards in the same line and go just after that character
- Would be nice if we could do this in a single stroke wouldn't it?
	- -LTDZ used as the original ending chord by default
	- -R => shift (same as emily) for capitalization of characters
	- -B => backwards
	- -F => find 
	- -P => previous character
- Steno equivalents
	- f: -F
	- F: -FB
	- t: -FP
	- T: -FPB

**** easy motion
- Code from this plugin: 
	- <leader><leader>f + character: find character anywhere in all windows
- Steno equivalent:
  	- <leader><leader>f + character: -PB
***** TODO need to think about how we enter the characters to locate the character

**** escaped characters
- No longer have to press "escape" every time you run a (single character) command
	- escape + character:
- Might not implement, let the user create one using the api
	- use a different ending chord?

**** macros
- macros are used for recording + replaying commands
	- q + character: record macro into this register
	- @ + character: play macro from this register
- Might not implement, let the user create one using the api
	- use a different ending chord?

**** double characters
- No longer have to spam so many times when you want to run a vim command
	- command * 2:
- Might not implement, let the user create one using the api
	- use a different ending chord?
