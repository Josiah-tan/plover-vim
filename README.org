* Plover-vim

- this is an ambitious project that aims to make vim even more ergonomic than it already is

* Motivation:

- plover phrasing systems
- slowness of changing between insert and normal mode

* Aims:

- (mostly) single chords for virtually every vim command combination

* Will not be implemented:

- control commands (already done in other plover plugins)

* Testing?:

- check for conflicts before outputing dictionary results to a file
