* Plover-vim

- this is an ambitious project that aims to make vim even more ergonomic than it already is for plover users!

* Motivation:

- slowness of changing between insert and normal mode
- plover phrasing systems
	- Create phrases in single strokes
	- Personally I use [[https://github.com/Jade-GG/plover_phrasing][Jade's]]
- Emily's [[https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-modifiers][modifiers]] + [[https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-symbols][symbol]] system
	- Contains all control, alt, windows, etc combined with every symbol that you would ever dream of

* Aims:

- Highly extensible and customisable commands and translations
- (mostly) single chords for virtually every vim command combination
- make vim's modal system uneccessary
	- more flexibility in what you can do in insert mode

* Will not be implemented:

- control commands (Already done in Emily's symbol + modifier system)

* Testing:

- [X] Check to see if translations are as expected
- [ ] Check for conflicts before outputting dictionary results to a file

* Modules:

- The system is designed with different modules, so that you can choose what you want and don't want to include
	- (currently there is only one module: relative\under{}number, but more are coming soon)

** Prerequisites
- Make sure to intall python-plover-dictionary from plover's plugins
	- Aerick has a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQZp7RX-h6o][video]] on this

** relative-number
*** What is relative-number?

- If you don't know what relative numbering is, then you are in for a treat
- Go on vim and search:
	- :help relativenumber
- It is good stuff

*** How does this plugin improve relative-number?
- You can jump to different lines (up and down) in a single stroke
- This is achieved by stroking a number like usual in addition another chord
	- '-7R' => down 7 times
	- '1-6B' => up 16 times
	- '1EUR7' => down 71 times
- Note that 'R' and 'B' are the same keys as what you'd use in qwerty for up and down

*** Limitations
- You can't go past 99 lines at a time

*** Usage
- copy templates/simple.py and add it to your dictionaries for a simple configuration
- copy templates/customised.py for a more customised experience
